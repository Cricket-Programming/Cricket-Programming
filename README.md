- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cricket
- ðŸ‘€ I've worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java and C#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m am currently spending most of my time programming doing C# in Unity. I'm also learning backend web development.
Check out my virtual reality game that's called Capuchin Caverns! https://www.meta.com/experiences/6832105786812201/
It's on the Meta Quest AppLab and is multiplayer.

I love building multiplayer VR games about monkeys.
My favorite monkey is the Capuchin.


The only project that I have on github (cricket-programming.github.io) is not well done so don't use it as a resource.
Once I have built a good project, I will post it here.
Cricket-Programming/Cricket-Programming is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
