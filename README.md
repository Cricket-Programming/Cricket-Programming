- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam Lazaro.
- I built and shipped Capuchin Caverns, a realtime multiplayer VR title on the Meta Horizon Store. After realizing the extensibility of physics-based hand locomotion, a VR technique developed only in 2021, I thought "wow, I can use this along with the appeal of realtime multiplayer tech like proximity voice chat and networked avatars to make a game that is fun. It evolved into a live system upon which I could rapidly test new features. Utilizing the power of event-driven RPCs, I made continuous new experiences for players, testing my ability to make networked systems which have scaled reliably to thousands of players a month.
