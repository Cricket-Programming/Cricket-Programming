- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cricket.
- At 13 years old, I started learning programming and the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm currently studying the Odin Project.
- For 3 years, I moved away from building websites to build my multiplayer virtual reality game, Capuchin Caverns (inspired by Capuchin!) on the Meta Horizon Store: https://www.meta.com/experiences/6832105786812201/
- Check out PhotonVR, a open source multiplayer network synchronization API that powers 90% of gorilla movement games that I'm currently making a pull request to: https://github.com/fchb1239/PhotonVR
