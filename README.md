 Hi, I’m Liam Lazaro.
- I built and shipped Capuchin Caverns, a multiplayer VR title on the Meta Horizon Store (15,000+ installs, 2000+ Monthly Active Users at peak). It combines physics-based locomotion: running, climbing, flying, and real-time multiplayer: state replication, proximity voice, networked avatars.
