- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cricket
- At 13, I started learning programming and the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- For 2 years,I moved away from building websites to build my multiplayer virtual reality game, Capuchin Caverns on the Meta Horizon Store: https://www.meta.com/experiences/6832105786812201/  
- Now, I am moving back toward building websites and learning more practical technologies. I'm currently doing the Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
