I build and operate multiplayer VR systems used by real players.

I shipped Capuchin Caverns, a social VR game on the Meta Horizon Store:
- 15,000+ Installs, ~2,000 Monthly Active Users at peak
- Physics-based locomotion (arm-driven movement, climbing, flying)
- Real-time multiplayer: state replication, proximity voice, networked avatars
- Live cosmetic economy backed by Azure PlayFab
- VR-native in-world checkout integrated with Meta’s payment flow

I like owning systems end-to-end and learning from what breaks in production.
