- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cricket-Programming
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development.

The only project that I have on github (cricket-programming.github.io) is not well done so don't use it as a resource.
Once I have built a good project, I will post it here.


<!---
Cricket-Programming/Cricket-Programming is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
