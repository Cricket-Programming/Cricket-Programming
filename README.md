- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cricket
- ðŸ‘€ I've worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, python, java and C#
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m am currently spending most of my time programming doing C# in unity.

The only project that I have on github (cricket-programming.github.io) is not well done so don't use it as a resource.
Once I have built a good project, I will post it here.
